# Shorky
Shorky is stress testing tool, which can go up to 10k requests per second, thats enought to bring down 99% school websites/small websites. I dont give a fuck if u use shorky illegaly, just know that im not responsible for anything illegal that u do with shorky. 

# How to install
Easiest way:
  Go to Shorky DDoS.py and copy all code inside, then paste it in visual code studio and save the file as Shorky.py if anyting doesnt work, or there is some error with modules, type     in visual code studio terminal this: pip install (your module).
  
However, there are more ways how to download Shorky but this is the best way
